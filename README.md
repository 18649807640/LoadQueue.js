Touch friendly version of Leaflet.draw was created by Michael Guild (https://github.com/michaelguild13).

The touch support was initiated due to a demand for it at National Geographic for their Map Maker Projected (http://mapmaker.education.nationalgeographic.com/) that was created by Michael Guild and Daniel Schep (https://github.com/dschep)

Thanks so much to [@brunob](https://github.com/brunob), [@tnightingale](https://github.com/tnightingale), and [@shramov](https://github.com/shramov). I got a lot of ideas from their Leaflet plugins.

All the [contributors](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw/graphs/contributors) and issue reporters of this plugin rock. Thanks for tidying up my mess and keeping the plugin on track.

The icons used for some of the toolbar buttons are either from http://glyphicons.com/ or inspired by them. <3 Glyphicons!

Finally, [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner) is the man! Thanks for dedicating so much of your time to create the gosh darn best JavaScript mapping library around.
